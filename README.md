# TCS-STOCK-DATA-PREDICTION
Here‚Äôs a complete outline for a Machine Learning Project on TCS Stock Data Analysis. This project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization, along with machine learning modeling to predict stock prices based on historical data. 
Objective
Analyze the historical data of TCS stock to gain insights into stock behavior, identify
trends, and forecast future stock prices.
I used LSTM MODEL because 
Why LSTM Is Better Than Traditional ML Models for Stock/Time-Series Prediction
üîÅ 1. LSTM Understands Sequences
Traditional ML models (like Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression) treat each input independently.

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) remembers previous steps in a sequence.

üìä Stock prices are sequential (yesterday affects today).
‚úÖ LSTM learns this pattern, while Random Forest does not.
